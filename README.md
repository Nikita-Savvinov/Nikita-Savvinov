### Hello, friend!

## :atom: About me:
My name is Nikita Savvinov and I'm chasing my dream! âœ¨

I built my career as an auditor and an IFRS specialist, but decided to do what I had been striving for since childhood to become an IT specialist.

Throughout my career as an economist, I have always implemented solutions that helped automate the workflow, so I came to the profession of a data engineer, and later began studying to the data scientist.
